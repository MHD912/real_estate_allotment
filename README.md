# Real Estate Allotment

Developed a standalone Windows application using Flutter to streamline real estate allotment studies for accountants. The app enables users to create detailed allotment studies based on stakeholders' shares in real estate and export the results into Excel workbooks.

**Key Features:**
- Data Management: Utilized the Isar database for local data storage, with support for JSON file import/export for data backup and restoration.
- State Management & Navigation: Implemented GetX for efficient state management and in-app navigation.
- Theming: Designed a user-friendly interface with light/dark themes.
- Deployment: Packaged the application into an EXE installer using Inno Setup Compiler and published it as a release on GitHub.
